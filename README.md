I'm currently working on my A.S. with a focus on programming, and I'm interested in Software Development. 
I have a long way to go but I'm eager to learn. 
I'm really enjoying coding and the logic behind code structure, so I can't wait to delve deeper into the code mines.

I'm open to small projects as I need to gain more experience with Java and coding in genenral.
